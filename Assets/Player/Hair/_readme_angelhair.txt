Hair: Angel
A curly hairstyle in a light blond color. Includes a matching hair cap. As you may guess, I remember this one was tedious work! It's now unused, so I hope it'll save somebody else a bit of time.

Specs -  

Fresh, crisp quads, mid-poly resolution. Clothing textures: 4096 diffuse, 2048 normal, 1024 specular. Accessory/hair textures: 2048 diffuse, 2048 normal, 1024 specular. It's debatable whether or not this style qualifies as PBR. It’s high-res, but not hyperrealistic. Partly hand-painted, partly photo-ref materials. Use it in any way that works for you.

FBX format, unrigged.

Readme Mad-Libs (fill in as you wish) 

Thanks for (buying / downloading) this (garment / hairstyle / accessory) from (Sketchfab / Gumroad / hopefully not an illegal pirating site.) Your business is very important to us. Please hold. 

In all seriousness, I appreciate it. I hope this asset serves you well. If you use this (especially if remixed or reinvented), I'd love a shout-out. If you want the component textures, such as the cloth wrinkles in the normals or the materials used to create it, just email me, it's fine.
